# tweet-trends
Tweet Trends is a web application that my partner, Thomas McHugh, and I implmented for our unversity's senior software practicum class.
We were tasked with developing an application that can be used to study the #MeToo movement on Twitter by correlating Tweets
containing the hashtag to the geographical locations that they were shared from. Our client was a professor within our school who leads a
research team that focuses on topics such as sexual assualt and the LGBTQ+ community.
